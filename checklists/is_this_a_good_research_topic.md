## Heuristics for paper importance and fertility 

1. Does it test some important but largely untested theory from economics or a related discipline? 
      1. What theory does it test? 
   	     1. How many citations does the theory paper have? 
		 1. Do any other papers claim to test that same theory? If so, 5Ws, plus citations.  
         1. How can you find theory papers that are in dispute? 
		    Probably by finding two theory papers that are of nearly the same vintage that cite each other in a quasi-adverserial way. 
		1. Do keyword search for phrases that are likely to suggest controversy - examples: 
		"unclear why" 
		"empirical question" 
		"horse race" 
		"theoretically ambiguous" 
		"empirical work is needed" 
 	1. Find papers that are comments on other papers 

1. Is there some government policy we would change if we knew the answer to the question?
	  1. If we made the change implied by the paper, what would be the effect on social welfare, in *dollars*?
	  1. Would the answer bolster or undermine the policy platform of a major US political party where the two parties are in diagreement? 

1. List the likely answers to the research questions. Are all answers interesting and publishable? 

If only one of the answers is publishable, it suggests the paper is just a counter-intuitive result type paper---those should probably be avoided. 
In other words, a precisely estimated zero should be publishable. 

1. Do the results have businss implications? 
   1. Would the high-level manger of a firm change how the firm does business if he or she knew the answer to the question?
      1. Would they organize their teams differently? 
      1. Would they change incentive structures or compensation? 
      1. Would they change their invest in people, technology, capital etc.?
      1. Would they pursue a different business model or strategy? 
   1. Could you create a business using the main idea in the paper? Could it be patented? 
  

1. Does it speak to some noticed social phenomena that are mysterious or for which the CW is likely wrong? 
      1. Try doing a Google search "for why..."

1. Has anyone senior in the discipline identified this as an important question? 

1. Could a laymen accurately predict the results? Would they say "so
what?"?  
   Could the paper overturn conventional wisdom ?
   * Note: We could actually do a survey, say on Google Survey to assess this claim. 

1. How many academics will care about the paper because it matters to their own work? 
   1. List them by name. 

1. Why hasn't this paper been written already? 
   1. The data needed to do the analysis didn't exist 
   1. Technological change of some kind of making this question more important 
   1. Theory being tested is new 
   1. No one has thought of it before, even though paper has long been possible (unlikely) 

1. Is this the very best domain to answer the question? 

1. Where, precisely, would the paper get a citation in the standard grad text in Labor, Public, Experimental etc.? 
   1. Does the paper gainsay anything in those books? Confirm anything that seems tenuous?  
   1. Write the line that cites your paper, in the correct place---does it flow? 
   
1. Does the paper answer an unanswered question? 
   1. Is there anything *surprising* about the results? 
   1. If they are not surprising, is it because they are dubious "common sense"? 

1. List 5 follow-up projects that one could feasibly do once the questions from this project are answered.

1. Identify 3 well-known, recent but not yet published (high profile working papers) that would cite your paper if it were written - where would it cite it and how important would the citation be?
