# table 

These are some general checklist items for effective economic-style tables. 
These are mostly taken from [Miller's "Writing About Multivariate Analysis"](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo3534182.html) and Michael Kremer's paper-writing checklist. 

1. Title states the purpose of the table 
1. Title/footnotes states the context of the data
    -  Why the data were collected
    -  When the data were collected 
    -  Where the data were collected
    -  How the data were collected   
1. Explain what data are missing/how sample chosen 
1. For each regression:  
    - All dependent variables explained
    - All rows explaned
    - All rows have units 
    - Model and estimation used 
    - How standard errors are calculated 
    - Interpration: causal or association?
    - If dummy variables used, explain reference category  
1. Layout: 
    - Minimal horizontal ruling 
    - Thick rule 
    - N line has thousands mark 
    - R-squared and sample size present 
    - Use LaTeX booktabs packages
1. Can the table be understood without reference to the main text?
